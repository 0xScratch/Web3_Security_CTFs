   Kind of a tricky one, especially the 2nd require check...

   It be better if you try seeking this out from other auditors, let me refer two of them

   1. cmichel -> He explained it quite well, just this solution is old so you be really feeling it not worth it, but still atleast something for a new learning stuff, Here's the link: https://cmichel.io/capture-the-ether-solutions/

   2. hackerNoon -> This is the latest one, and this guy has done it with 'create2' opcode, which is a bit different than the one we use 'create'..Back then 'create2' wasn't developed.. But it uses a module 'ethereumjs-util', which is kind of archived by it's owner. Thus, I felt a problem while making a use of it...
