# Capture_The_Ether
Let's practice some CTE questions!

# What's Changed??
- One doesn't need to interact with some 'old-school' Capture the Ether levels.These are based on the current solidity versions.
- No need to do that 'connect to metamask' thing, just copy down the question, Solve it, Seek the solution if stuck!
- There be a boolean `isPassed` in every level, if you able to turn it's value as true..then you nailed down that level

# Have Fun!
