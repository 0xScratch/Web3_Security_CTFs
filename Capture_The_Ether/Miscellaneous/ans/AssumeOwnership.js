    I guess this is one of the easiest level by far..you might be quite confused why that constructor line ain't showing any error like always..
    Here by constructor line I meant, Usually we declare the `constructor` as that's the rule in solidity 0.8, but in solidity 0.4.0 it was `function contractName() public`.

    And, this time this one works in solidity ^0.8, which might be a bit strange at first..

    For solving down the question, you just need an eagle eye and most of the auditors have already got it till now..
    Haven't got it? Just look carefully at the name of constructor function, it's spelled wrong!

    So, just call it and be the damn owner

    Cheers!
