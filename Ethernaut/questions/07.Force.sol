/*
    Another cool question, probably the first thought in your mind after seeing this would be, `What the Fuck`, anyways let's introduce this problem

    Some contracts will simply not take your money ¯\_(ツ)_/¯

    The goal of this level is to make the balance of the contract greater than zero.

    Things that might help:
        - Fallback methods
        - Sometimes the best way to attack a contract is with another contract.
        - see the section, "Beyond the console" -> means just try hacking it with a different contract
